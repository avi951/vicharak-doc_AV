 Vaaman FPGA Programming
#########################

The FPGA configuration is stored in a flash IC on the board. The flash
IC is Win-bond's W25Q128. The flash IC is connected to the FPGA via a
SPI bus.

The flash IC can be programmed internally using the `flashcp` tool. This
tool is available in the Vaaman Linux System Images.

or

The flash IC can be programmed externally using the JTAG or SPI
interface. This requires the `USB-to-JTAG` or `USB-to-SPI` Module.

 Uploading HEX files to Flash IC
*********************************

**To configure the FPGA using the flash IC, follow these steps:**

Hardware Connections
====================

Locate the 10-pin headers on the Vaaman board. These can be found from
the schematic.

Ensure the Vaaman board is powered On.


Connect the USB-to-SPI Module to the Vaaman board.

While connecting the Programmer module, make sure to follow the
indicated color code as shown in the image.

Download the HEX file
=====================

Download the DEMO HEX file from the :ref:`downloads` page.

Unzip the downloaded file.

Programming the Flash IC using Efinity
======================================

Open Efinity 2021.2 or later.

Inside the Efinity IDE

-  Refresh USB Target as shown in the image.
-  Select the Bitstream file to be programmed. (The bitstream file is
   available in the unzipped folder)
-  Select the SPI Flash Programming mode. (SPI Active)
-  Start the programming process.

Wait for the programming to complete. When the programming is complete,
the FPGA will be configured with the bitstream.

Verify the FPGA configuration
=============================

Once the programming is complete, you will observe the orange LED on the
Vaaman board blinking.

This indicates that the FPGA is configured with the bitstream.

   Additionally, you will notice that the four green LEDs on the Vaaman
   board will be blinking in a sequence.

*********************************
 Uploading BIT files to Flash IC
*********************************

To upload the BIT file to the flash IC, follow the steps mentioned
below:

Hardware Connections
====================

Locate the 10-pin headers on the Vaaman board. These can be found from
the schematic.

Ensure the Vaaman board is powered off and disconnected from the power
supply.

Connect the USB-to-JTAG Module to the Vaaman board.

While connecting the Programmer module, make sure to follow the
indicated color code as shown in the image.
